# mk8dLivesplit

This code generates split time distribution plots for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe speedruns saved with [LiveSplit](https://one.livesplit.org/).
The code has been tested with 48 tracks runs, although it should work with runs of any length.

For more information, read my [blogpost](https://chipdelmal.github.io/blog/).

## Splits Violins

This plot generates the distributions of each one of the splits. Median is highlighted in a thick rectangle, whilst the mean is shown in a thin line.

## Runs Time Series

Shows the cumulative times of the finished splits in one plot.
Darker lines are more recent runs, and the plot is centered around the mean, showing the deviation from the average time at that point in the run. Median is highlighted in each violin, and the final runtime is also shown.
